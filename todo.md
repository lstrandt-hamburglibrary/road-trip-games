## GPS Facts Feature Ideas

### Option 1: True GPS Location (Most Immersive)
- Use device GPS to detect current location
- Show facts about:
  - Current city/town you're driving through
  - State you're in
  - Nearby landmarks/points of interest
  - Historical markers you're passing

**Pros:** Automatic, real-time, very engaging
**Cons:** Requires location permissions, battery drain, needs internet/database, privacy concerns

### Option 2: State Selector (Simpler MVP) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Dropdown or map to select current state
- Show curated facts about that state:
  - Population, capital, founded date
  - State symbols (bird, flower, motto)
  - Famous people from that state
  - Fun trivia and "Did you know?" facts
  - Major landmarks and attractions

**Pros:** Works offline, no permissions, simple, built-in data
**Cons:** Manual selection, less automatic

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- GPS when available (with permission)
- Falls back to manual state/city selection
- Best of both worlds

### Option 4: Mile Marker / Highway Mode
- Enter highway number (I-95, Route 66, etc.)
- Enter current mile marker
- Show facts about that specific area/region
